First of all, I don’t think I could say that having a bit more knowledge of how to use another tool hurts.  If a blacksmith finds some niche way to use a rubber ducky in his or her work, more power to them. Therefore, I suppose the only thing I could maybe criticize about UI frameworks is the secondary effects of learning and applying it. That is to say, is spending the time to learn them worth not learning something else, and also does relying on frameworks have negative effects? Personally, I would say yes to both of them.


Frameworks seem like a useful tool to learn, and I would say that while their comparative usefulness is subjective and debatable, skipping out on them seems like a poor choice. Contemporary programming, especially at the student level, is build on the foundation of previous generations of computer scientists. There is a reason why we don’t program everything in notepad or vim even if it was possible; it’s because it would take much longer to write and test in that environment. Of course, Im sure it could be done, but it’s much faster to use an IDE or Notepad++ or something that is meant to make the process easier to visualize and construct. 


The same can be said for frameworks. Frameworks, no matter how flexible, have a finite amount of uses but they are meant to excel at those uses. Hours of time can saved by using a framework that one knows the capabilities and limits of, rather than trying to accomplish the same thing in, say, CSS or something. 


In the same way that people reusing code can lose out on useful learning and also creative expansion, frameworks can harm a programmer’s growth by giving them something to turn to and say “eh, that’s good enough.” Still, I think the pros outweigh the cons here as each framework learned makes it easier to learn another.
