#Overview:
The problem: 
Parking can be limited and inconsistent at times, and there's no existing application/platform to notify students of availability. 
The solution: 

* A crowdsourced app that gives hopefully up to date parking information about UH Manoa. 
* Possibly give information about specific lots and their status.
* Enables you to log in and find out saturation of various parking lots around UH.
* Proposed growth could include traffic and prediction of parking lot saturation. 



#Mockup page ideas:
-Landing page
-Login page
-Variable view general information page about the status of the lots, with both up-to-date and predictive info
  -heat map
  -tables
  -other ways of conveying this

-submission page (to add info or corroborate others' reports to rpevent abuse)
-admin page
  

#Use case ideas:
New user:
      New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets the general information page, maybe changes which view via dropdown, hopefully adds information to the system.
      Admin could log in, edit data, super-approve submissions, delete, flag or ban other. 
#Beyond the basics:
      * Proposed growth could include traffic and prediction of parking lot saturation based on previous data from that semester, previous semesters, or previous years.
