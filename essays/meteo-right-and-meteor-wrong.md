After these last few weeks of meteor, I can say that it's not as bad as I had originally thought. Given what it actually does, trying to implement that on my own would be just awful. That being said, it's still a pain to try and navigate where things should be while I'm not used to it. Furthermore, getting used to the Blaze template format is still taking some time to master, which is unsettling as the screencast mentions that it's one of the more easy formats to use. Furthermore, despite being seemingly straightforward, I'm still not 100% off the bat which directory things go in; some imports seem like pages and vice versa.

Still though, I generally get by with winging it and figuring things out solo along the way. This was the first time as a student in software engineering that I really had to crack open the readings and videos...and not watch at 4x speed. I suppose also that this is the first bit of learning that I've had to do for something that was released in the last five years or so. It's kind of nice to take a swing at some modern software rather than algorithms and programs that have been mastered and uber-optimized thirty years ago. It feels good being on the (somewhat) cutting edge of web development. Maybe the slicing edge, or the chopping edge. Well, five years is two and a half cycles of Moore's law so maybe it's more like the blunt edge, but it's still an edge!
